# Bended-Gear-animation
I'm not that new to blender. I'm having pretty good knowledge in terms of modeling, sculpting texturing. Even some good abilities in animating. But i'm stuck here. 
I want to animate a gear, which rotates like gears do, but is bend in the shape of a minimal surface circle, if you know what i mean. I tried to added a bone to each teeth and made it follow a curve. That was actually really close to what i wanted, but the bones made each teeth rotating along their individual z-axsis after a full spin. It was also too much effort to get there.

Actually, if i could animate the edges along the bending of the simple deform modifier, it would be absolutely perfect. I'm able to achieve my wanted result if i'm in edit mode, in the deformed gear, and am rotating everything along the z-axis, but obviously, in object mode everything, including the modifier, rotates.

So my question is, if there is to animate a spinning gear in this shape and how i'd get there.
